# Generative-unfoldings

I created a piece of generative art and I feel guilty about it.

I scraped 1.5 hours of 4k footage of flowers blooming from YouTube, and then split the footage into 14,000 frames. Then I trained a StyleGAN2 model on the data, and created a final video using output from the model: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jhj9-Hdcc&ab_channel=LiaColeman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jhj9-Hdcc&ab_channel=LiaColeman)

Since then, I've learned that I should have done it differently. In the past several months, I've become aware that as generative artists, we need to think critically about the data we use. I shouldn't have just wantonly scraped the data from Youtube. I should have asked for consent or permission from the original data owner. I also could have collected my own footage and photographs, instead of using someone else's creative property.

My project is to elaborate on that piece, by remaking it in a responsible manner. The final piece will be a juxtaposition of the two trained models, and the two datasets that were sourced in very different ways.
